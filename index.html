        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a Master's student in Computer Science with a specialization in Big Data Analytics Techniques, Cloud Computing, and Large-Scale Distributed Systems, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With over two years of software engineering experience, I have honed my skills in both data engineering and backend software development, working with industry-leading clients such as BlackRock and AIG.</p>
        <p>At BlackRock, I served as a Data Engineer, where I gained expertise in tools and technologies like Power BI, Airflow, Python, SQL, and the Hadoop ecosystem, including PySpark. My role involved optimizing data pipelines and creating scalable data solutions, which deepened my understanding of big data frameworks and analytics.</p>
        <p>In my role as a Backend Software Engineer for AIG, I developed and maintained robust software applications using technologies like ReactJS, Spring, Maven, Git, Gradle, and CI/CD pipelines. This experience allowed me to refine my coding practices, ensuring high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code.</p>
        <p>I am continuously seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills to new challenges, particularly in the realms of big data, cloud computing, and distributed systems. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology and deliver impactful solutions.</p>
